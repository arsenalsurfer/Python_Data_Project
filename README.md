# The Analysis

## 1. What are the most demanded skills for the top3 most popular data roles?

To find the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles. I filtered out those positions by which ones were the most popula, andgot the top 5 skills for these top 3 roles. this query highlights the most popular job titles and their top skills, showing which skills I shouldpay attention to depending on the role I'm targeting.

[2_Skill_Demand.ipynb](DA_Python_Data_Jobs_Project\2_Skills_Demand.ipynb)

### Visualize Data

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(job_titles), 1)

for i, job_title in enumerate(job_titles):
  df_plot = df_skills_perc[df_skills_perc['job_title_short'] == job_title].head(5)
  # df_plot.plot(kind='barh', x='job_skills', y='skill_percent', ax=ax[i], title=job_title)
  sns.barplot(data=df_plot, x='skill_percent', y='job_skills', ax=ax[i], hue='skill_count', palette='dark:b_r')
  sns.despine() # remove the border
  ax[i].set_title(job_title)
  ax[i].set_ylabel('')
  ax[i].set_xlabel('')
  ax[i].get_legend().remove()
  ax[i].set_xlim(0, 78)

  for n, v in enumerate(df_plot['skill_percent']):
    ax[i].text(v + 1, n, f'{v:.0f}%', va='center')

  if i != len(job_titles) -1:
    ax[i].set_xticks([])

fig.suptitle('Likelihood of Skills Requested in US Job Postings', fontsize=15)
fig.tight_layout(h_pad=0.5) # fix the overlap
plt.show()

```

### Results

![1_Visualizations of Top SKills for Data Nerds](DA_Python_Data_Jobs_Project\images\skill_demand_all_data_roles.png)

### Insights

- Python is a versatile skill, highly demanded accross all three roles, but most prominently for Data Scientist (72%) and Data Engineers (65%).
- SQL is the most requested skills for Data Analysts and Data Scientist, with it in over half the job postings for both roles. For Data Engineers, Python is the most sought-after skill, appearing in 68% of job postings.
- Data Engineers require more specialized technical skills (AWS, Azure, Spark) comparedto Data Analysts and Data Scientists who areexpected to be proficient in more general datamanagement and analysis tools (Excel, Tableau).

# The Analysis

## 2. How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts?

### Visualize Data

```python

df_plot = df_DA_US_percent.iloc[:, :5]

sns.lineplot(data=df_plot, dashes=False, palette='tab10')
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')
sns.despine()

from matplotlib.ticker import PercentFormatter
ax = plt.gca()
ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(PercentFormatter(decimals=0))

plt.title('Trending Top Skills for Data Analyst in the US')
plt.ylabel('Likelihood in Job Posting')
plt.xlabel('2023')
plt.legend().remove()

for i in range(5):
  plt.text(11.2, df_plot.iloc[-1, i], df_plot.columns[i])

plt.show()

```

_Bar graph visualizing the trending top skills for data analysts in the US in 2023._

### Insights:

- SQL remains the most consistently demanded skill throughout the year, although it shows a gradual decrease in demand.
- Excel experienced a significant increase in demand starting around September, surpassing both Python and Tableau by the end of the year.
- Both Python and Tableau show relatively stable demand throughout the year with some fluctutations but remain essential skills for data analysts.Power BI, while less demanded compared to theothers, shows a slight upward trend toward the year's end.

## 3. How well do jobs and skills pay for the Data Analysts?

### Salary Analisys for Data Persons

```python

sns.boxplot(data=df_US_top6, x='salary_year_avg', y='job_title_short', order=job_order)
#plt.boxplot(job_list, labels=job_titles, vert=False)
plt.title('Salary Distribution in the United States')
plt.xlabel('Yearly Salary ($USD)')
plt.ylabel('')
ax = plt.gca()
ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, pos: f'${int(x/1000)}K'))
plt.xlim(0, 600000)

plt.show()

```

### Results

![3_Project/images/salary_boxplot.png](DA_Python_Data_Jobs_Project\images\3_how_well_do_jobs_and_skills_pay_for_Data_Analysts.png)

_Box plot visualizong the salary distribution for the top 6 data job titles_

### Insights:

- There's a significant variation in salary ranges across different job titles. Senior Data Scientistpositions tend to have the highest salary potential, with up to $600K, indicating the high value placed on advanced data skills and experience in the industry.
- Senior Data Engineer and Senior Data Scientist roles show a considerable number of outliers on the higher end of the salary spectrum, suggesting that exceptional skills or ciscumstances can lead to high pay in these roles. In contrast, Data Analyst roles demonstate more consistency in salary, with fewer outliers.
- The median salaries increase with the seniority and specializations of the roles. Senior roles (Senior Data Scientist, Senior Data Engineer) not only have higher median salaries but also larger differences in typical salaries, reflecting greater variance in compensation as responsibilities increase.

### Higest Paid & Most Demanded Skills for Data Analyst

#### Visualize Data

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 1)

# Color Palette: Sequential, Diverging, Qualitative
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')
#df_DA_top_pay[::-1].plot(kind='barh', y='median', ax=ax[0], legend=False)
sns.barplot(data=df_DA_top_pay, x='median', y=df_DA_top_pay.index, ax=ax[0], hue='median', palette='dark:b_r') # to reverse color palette add _r in the end of the color
ax[0].legend().remove()

ax[0].set_title('Top 10 Higest Paid Skills for Data Analysts')
ax[0].set_ylabel('')
ax[0].set_xlabel('')
ax[0].xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, _: f'${int(x/1000)}K'))

#df_DA_skills[::-1].plot(kind='barh', y='median', ax=ax[1], legend=False)
sns.barplot(data=df_DA_skills, x='median', y=df_DA_skills.index, ax=ax[1], hue='median', palette='light:b')
ax[1].legend().remove()

ax[1].set_title('Top 10 Most in Demand Skills for Data Analysts')
ax[1].set_ylabel('')
ax[1].set_xlabel('Median Salary ($USD)')
ax[1].set_xlim(ax[0].get_xlim())
ax[1].xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, _: f'${int(x/1000)}K'))

#### Results

![4_highest_paid_and_most_demand_skills.png](DA_Python_Data_Jobs_Project\images\4_highest_paid_and_most_demand_skills.png)

_Two seperate bar graphs visualizing the highest paid skills and most in-demand skills for data analyst in the US_

#### Insights:

- The top graph shows specialized technical skills like `dplyr`, `Bitbucket`, and `Gitlab` are associated with higher salaries, some reaching up to $200K, suggesting that advanced technical proficiency can increase earning potential.
- The bottom graph highlights that foundational skills like `Excel`, `Powerpoint`, and `SQL` are the most in-demand, even though they may not offer the highest salaries. This demonstrates the importance of these core skills for employability in data analysis roles.
- There's a clear distinction between the skills that are highest paid and those that are most in-demand. Data Analysts aiming to maximize their career potential should consider developing a diverese skill set that includes both high-paying diverse skill set that includes both high-paying specialized skills and widely demanded foundational skills.
